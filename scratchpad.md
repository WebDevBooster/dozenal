# Scratchpad

This scratchpad is just a place for dumping my loosely written notes that I kept some place else. This might be useful to see the path of the development process or understand the reasons why certain things have been chosen to be in particular way.

Instead of "point" to denote fractions we could say "nib" to denote dozenal fractions.
So, "three point one six" in decimal would be equivalent to 
"three nib one el" in dozenal.
The nib could be a dot either in the middle of the line-height or at the top.

"den" should be short for dozen (not "doe" or "doh")

And instead of "-ty" for second-order words like twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, sixty, seventy, eighty, ninety
we'd use "-da" (pronounced the same way as "do" in dozen) and "-ra" like so: 
• twenda or just twen or twez (for twenty); better: twes
• thira or trez (threz was autocorrected to three) for thirty because "thirda" is harder to pronounce is also gets autocorrected to "third" (although in some languages trez stands for 13: https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/trez and https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/treize ); "twez" and "trez" could be confused in pronunciation, so, we'll probably have to go with "thres" and "twes" because of that and also because "s" is easier to type on my keyboard layout and even on a standard keyboard layout.

* fora 
* fifda 
* sixda
* sevenda or sevda
* eighda 
* nineda or ninda
* dekda
* elda

"Like every new system, some words/terms I'm gonna outline in this article are gonna feel weird at first, but you're gonna get used to it within 20 minutes."

TODO: 
Refute some of the ideas from here: 
http://www.dozenalsociety.org.uk/roses/mechow.html
but also credit him for giving me the idea of keeping some parts like "twen-" in "twenda" and "thir-" in "thira". 

Now, the question is: 
What do we use to replace eleven, twelve, thirteen, fourteen, fifteen, sixteen, seventeen, eighteen, nineteen?

First, let's tackle the numbers 13 to 19: 
"-teen" is used in decimal and it is sometimes confused with "-ty".
Well, we can use "-deen" as the ending like: 

* thirdeen or thireen (because of easier pronunciation)
* fordeen or foreen (because of easier pronunciation)
* fifdeen
* sixdeen
* sevedeen or sevdeen (leave out the "t" to avoid confusion with seventeen)
* eighdeen (leave out the "t" to avoid confusion with eighteen)
* ninedeen 
* dekdeen
* eldeen

Now, to replace words for 11 and 12, we would use "onedeen" and "twodeen".
After all, we already have "dek" and "el" i.e. two short words that mirror the uniqueness of "eleven" and "twelve" in the decimal system.
And "den" will be short for dozen.
So, it's fine to have the regular form of "one + deen" and "two + deen" in dozenal. 
In some languages "trez" stands for 13: https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/trez and https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/treize )

10 in dozenal (12 in decimal): den or dozen.

* '11 => onedeen -> solreen (sol for solitary)
* '12 => twodeen -> twereen
* '13 => thireen 
* '14 => foreen 
* '15 => fifdeen -> fifreen
* '16 => sixdeen -> sixreen
* '17 => sevdeen -> sevreen
* '18 => eighdeen -> eithreen
* '19 => ninedeen -> nireen
* '1X => dekdeen -> dekreen
* '1E => eldeen -> elreen

--

* '20 => twez -> tweda
* '30 => threz-> trez (this isn't Spanish after all) -> treda
* '40 => fora (the "d" in forda disappears when speaking quickly)
* '50 => fifda 
* '60 => sixda 
* '70 => sevda 
* '80 => eighda 
* '90 => nineda 
* 'X0 => dekda 
* 'E0 => elda 


100 in dozenal (144 in decimal): "grezn"
(short for "great dozen").

Instead of "percent" (where "cent" is for 100 in decimal), 
we could use "pergren" where "gren" is a shortened version of "grezn".

A dozen is commonly abbreviated doz or dz.

1,000 in dozenal (1728 in decimal): "granden".  
10,000 in dozenal (20,736 in decimal): "den granden".  
100,000 in dozenal (248,832 in decimal): "grezn granden".

---

1,000,000 in dozenal (2,985,984 in decimal): "magzen" 
("magnificent dozen"; earlier idea: "joyden").  
10,000,000 in dozenal (35,831,808 in decimal): "den magzen".  
100,000,000 in dozenal (429,981,696 in decimal): "grezn magzen".

--- 

1,000,000,000 in dozenal (5,159,780,352 in decimal): "brilzen"
("brilliant dozen").

1,000,000,000,000 (8,916,100,448,256 in decimal): "tremzen"
("tremendous dozen").

Quadrillion => quadzen  
Quintillion => quinzen  
Sextillion => sextizen  
Septillion => septizen  
Octillion => octizen  
Nonillion => nonizen
