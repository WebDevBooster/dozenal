# Dozenal

## Superior numeral system for day-to-day use and the primary numeral system for [Star City](https://github.com/WebDevBooster/star-city-manifesto)

### The Why

#### Dozenal is 2x better than decimal.

Why aren't people using the [**binary**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_number) system of numerals in day-to-day life? After all, computers can and do calculate EVERYTHING using just ones and zeros. All calculations in maths, engineering, programming, science... ALL of them can be done perfectly well using the binary system. 

So, shouldn't we all just switch to using ones and zeros (just 2 numbers) for counting and calculating everything?

Why do humans use a base-ten i.e. the decimal system instead of the binary system?

Because for *human use* the binary system is super-unwieldy. That's why. 

While perfect for computers, the binary system is *hard to use* for humans in daily life. That's why most people prefer to use the decimal system in normal day-to-day life. You know, using ten numbers 0 to 9. 

But what if there was a numeral system that's not just slightly better but **TWO TIMES BETTER than decimal?** 

For humans. In daily life. 

Well, such system exists. It's called **dozenal** and instead of ten numbers it uses twelve numbers: zero to el. 

So, each of the twelve numbers in dozenal is a **single digit** number. The number ten is called **dek** in dozenal and the biggest single digit dozenal number is called **el**. 

#### Zero, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, dek, el.

And instead of counting to just ten on your hands (like a medieval peasant), you can use those same two hands to count to a **DOZEN DOZENS!** (that's 144 for medieval peasants)

What's that?... 144 is more than twice better?

Well, I was lying. 

I'm glad you already agree that the dozenal system is MUCH BETTER. :-)
 
 But here's what I meant by "2x better": 

In layman's terms a *divisor* or a *factor* is a number than can be used to divide another number so that nothing remains. "Clean" division with *no remainder*, no fractions. That's the idea. 

In every-day life — **as a human** — you want a numeral system that gives you as many divisors/factors as possible because dealing with fractions like 3.333333333333333 or 2.666666666666667 is nasty, annoying and... *inhuman*. 

It stinks!

You don't want to ever see those stinky fractions in your normal day-to-day life. You have better things to do than squeezing your nose in response to the agonizing pain caused by that stench. 

That's because we are human. Not robots. 

As humans we like when things are neat, clean, nice and tidy. It just feels good. It makes you smile. And it smells like the best royal fragrance you can imagine. Yes, it smells like royalty and the best thing is: you can hold it in your hands. You can **count** on it. And of course, you can also use it to count. And calculate. 

Long story short, when ignoring *trivial* divisors (every number can be divided cleanly by 1 and by itself), the number ten can only be divided by *two* and in *half*. So, only two non-trivial divisors for medieval peasants. That's why they stink so much. They constantly have to deal with those stinky fractions. Forever. 

But when you ascend to the royal status by switching to the dozenal system, you gain TWO additional non-trivial divisors. Because not only can a dozen be divided cleanly by *two* and in *half* but things also remain squeeky clean when a dozen is divided by *three* or by *four*. 
 
#### TWO TIMES MORE non-trivial divisors is 2x better for day-to-day human use.

This is why the dozenal system will be the primary numeral system in [Star City](https://github.com/WebDevBooster/star-city-manifesto). It's 2 times better (for daily human use) and **everything** in Star City will be at least 2 times better compared to what you're used to.

Our computers will keep using the binary system because that's better for *them*. And in engineering and programming we might keep using the decimal system (for backward compatibility etc.). But for day-to-day *human* use the dozenal system is superior to the decimal system. That's a fact. 

By the way, in Star City, we'll also be using a [completely new calendar system](https://github.com/WebDevBooster/Starlendar) that you'll especially enjoy after your ascend to the dozenal royalty. :-)


### Dozenal Societies

Before we talk about the *how*, I'm gonna say something that some might consider "controversial". I'm aware that things like the Dozenal Society of Great Britain and the Dozenal Society of America exist. And I say that: 

#### It's safe to *ignore* what the Dozenal Society of Great Britain or the Dozenal Society of America have ever said or done.

Why? 

If someone doesn't understand even the most fundamental BASICS of persuasion i.e. something that's required for anyone who is even remotely serious about establishing this system in the world, then they should stay OUT of a conversation. Until they learn at least those ***rudimentary BASICS***. 

It might only take half an hour to learn the basics but you gotta do it before you try to "chip in" in a conversation on the topic. 

If someone doesn't even know that `1 + 1 = 2` in maths, you can't take them seriously if they try to join a conversation about differential equations. One can't fail any harder if they think that `1 + 1 = 11` **in maths**. Mathematical rules are crystal clear. `1 + 1` always equals `2` in maths. No ambiguity, no exceptions. 

That's a metaphor to say that people running those societies are as clueless about the most rudimentary basics of persuasion as it gets. They need to understand at least those BASICS before they can join this conversation. 

But hey, those societies can do whatever they want. 

I'm just saying that **in Star City** we'll completely ignore their suggestions. 

And the ultimate "proof" will be "in the pudding". 

In other words, the only thing that matters in the end are the RESULTS.  
Results as in: 

#### How many people are actually *using* the system you're promoting?

I can tell you that even blindfolded and with both of my hands tied behind my back, I'll get more people to use the dozenal system than all of those societies combined. So, whatever those societies are saying or proposing, **it doesn't matter**. I ignore it. 


### The Guidelines

The following guidelines are meant to allow anyone to join this discussion or work on the development of the dozenal system. Even if you aren't a persuasion expert. It's possible that we might deviate from a guideline on occasion, but the aim should be to keep as close to them as possible. 

The core idea is: 

We aren't introducing the dozenal system in a vacuum. We are competing with a firmly established decimal system. It IS a competition! 

So, ideally, ***every single element*** of the dozenal system we introduce... ***every single word*** etc. should be **AT LEAST AS GOOD OR BETTER** than the decimal counterpart!

**AT LEAST AS GOOD OR BETTER!**

Every little thing!

If even just one little thing in our dozenal system is inferior or ***seems*** inferior... ***feels*** inferior... ***sounds*** inferior compared to the decimal counterpart, that's unacceptable. 

EVERY little thing must be **AT LEAST AS GOOD OR BETTER!**

I'll give you one example to get you on the right track:

The **proposed** dozenal counterpart for the word *hundred* is "gross". And according to [this Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_%28unit%29) that word/name seems to have a historical or traditional background. 

Now, the question is: What's wrong with that? 

What's wrong with using the word "gross" as the dozenal counterpart for the word *hundred*?

Based on the core idea of this chapter, you should be able to immediately answer that question. You should immediately KNOW — within the first **second** of you reading that word — why it cannot be used for our purposes.

And if you do know... if you ***felt*** within a split-second of you reading that word the reason why we absolutely cannot use that word for our purposes, then congratulations! You've passed the test.

Even without being a persuasion expert you can now discuss this topic and make meaningful contributions to developing this system. 

*But shouldn't we respect the traditional background of the word "gross" and use it anyway?*

Here's a brilliant definition of the word tradition: 

> **Tradition**  
> *Peer pressure from dead people.*

In Star City, we'll actively try to break and DESTROY as many traditions as we can get our hands on. And then we'll create our own traditions (if we feel like it). 

Oh, and in case you happen to be a slow learner, [Wiktionary lists](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/gross) a number of different defininions of the word "gross". Among them: 

> *(of behaviour considered to be wrong)* Highly or conspicuously offensive.

or 

> *(slang, Canada, US)* Causing disgust.

or 

> Lacking refinement in behaviour or manner; offending a standard of morality.

Those are all *modern* definitions of the word. And while those are all definitions of "gross" as the adjective and not as the noun, it doesn't matter. 

What matters is what people instinctively ***feel*** when using that word. Feel within a split-second. 

Would using the word "gross" as the dozenal counterpart to the word hundred FEEL that this word is **AT LEAST AS GOOD OR BETTER** than the word *hundred*? 

No, it wouldn't. End of story.
