# Dozenal: Superior Numeral System for Human Use

## The primary numeral system for [Star City](https://github.com/WebDevBooster/star-city-manifesto)

---

## The Why

### Dozenal is 2x better than decimal.

Why aren't people using the [**binary**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_number) system of numerals in day-to-day life? After all, computers can and do calculate EVERYTHING using just ones and zeros. All calculations in maths, engineering, programming, science... ALL of them can be done perfectly well using the binary system. 

So, shouldn't we all just switch to using ones and zeros (just 2 numbers) for counting and calculating everything?

Why do humans use a base-ten i.e. the decimal system instead of the binary system?

Because for *human use* the binary system is super-clunky. That's why. 

While perfect for computers, the binary system is *hard to use* for humans in daily life. That's why most people prefer to use the decimal system in normal day-to-day life. You know, using ten numbers 0 to 9. 

But what if there was a numeral system that's not just slightly better but **TWO TIMES BETTER than decimal?** 

For humans. In daily life. 

Well, such system exists. It's called **dozenal** and instead of ten numbers it uses twelve numbers: zero to el. 

So, each of the twelve numbers in dozenal is a **single digit** number. The number ten is called **dek** in dozenal and the biggest single digit dozenal number is called **el**. 

### Zero, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, dek, el.

And instead of counting to just ten on your hands (like a medieval peasant), you can use those same two hands to count to a **DOZEN DOZENS!** (that's 144 for medieval peasants)

What's that?... 144 is more than twice better?

Well, I was lying. 

I'm glad you already agree that the dozenal system is MUCH BETTER. :-)
 
 But here's what I meant by "2x better": 

In layman's terms a *divisor* or a *factor* is a number than can be used to divide another number so that nothing remains. "Clean" division with *no remainder*, no fractions. That's the idea. 

In every-day life — **as a human** — you want a numeral system that gives you as many divisors/factors as possible because dealing with fractions like 3.333333333333333 or 2.666666666666667 is nasty, annoying and... *inhuman*. 

It stinks!

You don't want to ever see those stinky fractions in your normal day-to-day life. You have better things to do than squeezing your nose in response to the agonizing pain caused by that stench. 

That's because we are human. Not robots. 

As humans we like when things are neat, clean, nice and tidy. It just feels good. It makes you smile. And it smells like the best royal fragrance you can imagine. Yes, it smells like royalty and the best thing is: you can hold it in your hands. You can **count** on it. And of course, you can also use it to count. And calculate. 

Long story short, when ignoring *trivial* divisors (every number can be divided cleanly by 1 and by itself), the number ten can only be divided by *two* and in *half*. So, only two non-trivial divisors for medieval peasants. That's why they stink so much. They constantly have to deal with those stinky fractions. Forever. 

But when you ascend to the royal status by switching to the dozenal system, you gain TWO additional non-trivial divisors. Because not only can a dozen be divided cleanly by *two* and in *half* but things also remain squeeky clean when a dozen is divided by *three* or by *four*. 
 
### TWO TIMES MORE non-trivial divisors is 2x better for day-to-day human use.

This is why the dozenal system will be the primary numeral system in [Star City](https://github.com/WebDevBooster/star-city-manifesto). It's 2 times better (for daily human use) and **everything** in Star City will be at least 2 times better compared to what you're used to.

Our computers will keep using the binary system because that's better for *them*. And in engineering and programming we might keep using the decimal system (for backward compatibility etc.). But for day-to-day *human* use the dozenal system is superior to the decimal system. That's a fact. 

By the way, in Star City, we'll also be using a [completely new calendar system](https://github.com/WebDevBooster/Starlendar) that you'll especially enjoy after your ascend to the dozenal royalty. :-)

## Dozenal Societies

Before we talk about the *how*, I'm gonna say something that some might consider "controversial". I'm aware that things like the Dozenal Society of Great Britain and the Dozenal Society of America exist. And I say that: 

### It's safe to *ignore* what the Dozenal Society of Great Britain or the Dozenal Society of America have ever said or done.

Why? 

If someone doesn't understand even the most fundamental BASICS of persuasion i.e. something that's required for anyone who is even remotely serious about establishing this system in the world, then they should stay OUT of a conversation. Until they learn at least those ***rudimentary BASICS***. 

It might only take half an hour to learn the basics but you gotta do it before you try to "chip in" in a conversation on the topic. 

If someone doesn't even know that `1 + 1 = 2` in maths, you can't take them seriously if they try to join a conversation about differential equations. One can't fail any harder if they think that `1 + 1 = 11` **in maths**. Mathematical rules are crystal clear. `1 + 1` always equals `2` in maths. No ambiguity, no exceptions. 

That's a metaphor to say that people running those societies are as clueless about the most rudimentary basics of persuasion as it gets. They need to understand at least those BASICS before they can join this conversation. 

But hey, those societies can do whatever they want. 

I'm just saying that **in Star City** we'll completely ignore their suggestions. 

And the ultimate "proof" will be "in the pudding". 

In other words, the only thing that matters in the end are the RESULTS.  
Results as in: 

### How many people are actually *using* the system you're promoting?

I can tell you that even blindfolded and with both of my hands tied behind my back, I'll get more people to use the dozenal system than all of those societies combined. So, whatever those societies are saying or proposing, **it doesn't matter**. I ignore it.

## The Guidelines

The following guidelines are meant to allow anyone to join this discussion or work on the development of the dozenal system. Even if you aren't a persuasion expert. It's possible that we might deviate from a guideline on occasion, but the aim should be to keep as close to them as possible. 

The core idea is: 

We aren't introducing the dozenal system in a vacuum. We are competing with a firmly established decimal system. It IS a competition! 

So, ideally, ***every single element*** of the dozenal system we introduce... ***every single word*** etc. should be **AT LEAST AS GOOD OR BETTER** than the decimal counterpart!

**AT LEAST AS GOOD OR BETTER!**

Every little thing!

If even just one little thing in our dozenal system is inferior or ***seems*** inferior... ***feels*** inferior... ***sounds*** inferior compared to the decimal counterpart, that's unacceptable. 

EVERY little thing must be **AT LEAST AS GOOD OR BETTER!**

I'll give you one example to get you on the right track:

The **proposed** dozenal counterpart for the word *hundred* is "gross". And according to [this Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_%28unit%29) that word/name seems to have a historical or traditional background. 

Now, the question is: What's wrong with that? 

What's wrong with using the word "gross" as the dozenal counterpart for the word *hundred*?

Based on the core idea of this chapter, you should be able to immediately answer that question. You should immediately KNOW — within the first **second** of you reading that word — why it cannot be used for our purposes.

And if you do know... if you ***felt*** within a split-second of you reading that word the reason why we absolutely cannot use that word for our purposes, then congratulations! You've passed the test.

Even without being a persuasion expert you can now discuss this topic and make meaningful contributions to developing this system. 

*But shouldn't we respect the traditional background of the word "gross" and use it anyway?*

Here's a brilliant definition of the word tradition: 

> **Tradition**  
> *Peer pressure from dead people.*

In Star City, we'll actively try to break and DESTROY as many traditions as we can get our hands on. And then we'll create our own traditions (if we feel like it). 

Oh, and in case you happen to be a slow learner, [Wiktionary lists](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/gross) a number of different defininions of the word "gross". Among them: 

> *(of behaviour considered to be wrong)* Highly or conspicuously offensive.

or 

> *(slang, Canada, US)* Causing disgust.

or 

> Lacking refinement in behaviour or manner; offending a standard of morality.

Those are all *modern* definitions of the word. And while those are all definitions of "gross" as the adjective and not as the noun, it doesn't matter. 

What matters is what people instinctively ***feel*** when using that word. Feel within a split-second. 

Would using the word "gross" as the dozenal counterpart to the word hundred FEEL that this word is **AT LEAST AS GOOD OR BETTER** than the word *hundred*? 

No, it wouldn't. End of story. 

Here's another example... And this is gonna be your final test question if you wanna level up. 

The word dozen is a great word on many occasions. Especially if you want to emphasize. But we also need a shorter counterpart to the word ten. 

The **proposed** dozenal counterpart for that is "doe".

Now, tell me: What's wrong with that?

If you can see several things, what's the **main** reason why "doe" cannot be used as the dozenal counterpart to the word ten?

It's lame. That's the main reason. Go ahead, say that word out loud. Can you feel how lame-ass "doe" feels when compared to *ten*?

In pronunciation, *ten* feels snappy and fast. In contrast to that, "doe" feels like a lame, 3-legged donkey. 

So, there's zero chance we'll ever use that word for this purpose. 

See how much emphasis there is on FEELINGS?

That's because people make decisions based on emotions and then, later, justify those decisions with logic. 

When you present this new dozenal system to them, people will decide within 3 SECONDS whether they like it or not. So, 3 seconds is the MAXIMUM you've got. Many people will decide long before the 3 seconds are up. The emotional, gut-level ***feeling*** is what will make them decide. 

And if you roll up with a lame-ass donkey, the decision is gonna be against you. Good night! 

Now, that you've leveled up to the status of a "persuasion master", you are ready for the third and most advanced example. The biggest single digit numbers in the dozenal system are the number *dek* and the number *el*. 

But here's the problem: Neither of those numbers has a counterpart in the decimal system. Both numbers are unique. So, what do you do now? How do you make sure that both numbers are **AT LEAST AS GOOD OR BETTER** than their decimal counterparts if they don't have any counterparts in the decimal system?

This is something you can only handle as a "persuasion master" and since you've reached that level (congratulations!), you are equipped to handle this. 

To be clear: Right now, we are only talking about the **names** of those numbers. Their names in English, not their numerical representation. So, the words "dek" and "el" are the subject of this discussion. 

There's nothing in the decimal system to compare them to. No counterparts. 

In this case, you have to take an analytical approach while still keeping in mind that your gut is the ***primary*** decision-maker. Your gut feelings, your emotions take precedence over any analytics. Because every other human will react exactly the same way. 

So, number "dek". Only 3 characters. Nice and short. No idiotic letter "c" nonsense, no "ck", just one letter "k" at the end as it should be where you have a "k" sound. CLEAN! 

OK, it "looks" good but how does it FEEL? And how does it sound?

Well, it sounds nice and snappy. Energetic. Dynamic. And it feels GREAT! 

What about the number "el" then? 

The word for number "el" only consists of 2 letters. Wow! It doesn't get any shorter than that. And it feels and sounds amazing. The beauty and simplicity of that word is mesmerizing. It will make every dozenal user happy that the word for the single digit number with the highest value is such a beauty. 

The word "el" also has a mnemonic connection to the word "eleven". That's a bonus. 

Perfect! With *dek* and *el* we have two words that have already been engineered to perfection. So, we can copy them as is. I don't know who has engineered those words, but they've done an excellent job. 

### Summary

Every element of the dozenal system must *look, feel and sound* **AT LEAST AS GOOD OR BETTER** than their decimal counterpart. And if no such counterparts exist, the elements must *look, feel and sound* in a way that emphasizes the superiority of the dozenal system. 

### Dozenal Elements Checklist

Compared to its decimal counterpart... 

- [ ] is the word element at least as short or shorter? (number of characters)
- [ ] is it easy to pronounce? (both individually and combined with others?)
- [ ] is it easy to understand and is there no potential confusion with other numbers?
- [ ] is it free from undesirable associations?
- [ ] does it look at least as good or better?
- [ ] does it feel at least as good or better?
- [ ] does it sound at least as good or better?
