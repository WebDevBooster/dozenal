# Dozenal

## Superior numeral system for day-to-day use and the primary numeral system for [Star City](https://github.com/WebDevBooster/star-city-manifesto)

### The Why

#### Dozenal is 2x better than decimal.

Why aren't people using the [**binary**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_number) system of numerals in day-to-day life? After all, computers can and do calculate EVERYTHING using just ones and zeros. All calculations in maths, engineering, programming, science... ALL of them can be done perfectly well using the binary system. 

So, shouldn't we all just switch to using ones and zeros (just 2 numbers) for counting and calculating everything?

Why do humans use a base-ten i.e. the decimal system instead of the binary system?

Because for *human use* the binary system is super-unwieldy. That's why. 

While perfect for computers, the binary system is *hard to use* for humans in daily life. That's why most people prefer to use the decimal system in normal day-to-day life. You know, using ten numbers 0 to 9. 

But what if there was a numeral system that's not just slightly better but **TWO TIMES BETTER than decimal?** 

For humans. In daily life. 

Well, such system exists. It's called **dozenal** and instead of ten numbers it uses twelve numbers: zero to el. 

So, each of the twelve numbers in dozenal is a **single digit** number. The number ten is called **dek** in dozenal and the biggest single digit dozenal number is called **el**. 

And instead of counting to just ten on your hands (like a medieval peasant), you can use those same two hands to count to a **DOZEN DOZENS!** (that's 144 for medieval peasants)

What's that?... 144 is more than twice better?

Well, I was lying. 

I'm glad you already agree that the dozenal system is MUCH BETTER. :-)
 
 But here's what I meant by "2x better": 

In layman's terms a *divisor* or a *factor* is a number than can be used to divide another number so that nothing remains. "Clean" division with *no remainder*, no fractions. That's the idea. 

In every-day life — **as a human** — you want a numeral system that gives you as many divisors/factors as possible because dealing with fractions like 1.333333333333333 or 4.666666666666666 is nasty, annoying and... *inhuman*. 

It stinks!

You don't want to ever see those stinky fractions in your normal day-to-day life. You have better things to do than squeezing your nose in response to the agonizing pain caused by that stench. 

That's because we are human. Not robots. 

As humans we like when things are neat, clean, nice and tidy. It just feels good. It makes you smile. And it smells like the best royal fragrance you can imagine. Yes, it smells like royalty and the best thing is: you can hold it in your hands. You can **count** on it. And of course, you can also use it to count. And calculate. 

Long story short, when ignoring *trivial* divisors (every number can be divided cleanly by 1 and by itself), the number ten can only be divided by *two* and in *half*. So, only two non-trivial divisors for medieval peasants. That's why they stink so much. They constantly have to deal with those stinky fractions. Forever. 

But when you ascend to the royal status by switching to the dozenal system, you gain TWO additional non-trivial divisors. Because not only can a dozen be divided cleanly by *two* and in *half* but things also remain squeeky clean when a dozen is divided by *three* or by *four*. 
 
#### TWO TIMES MORE non-trivial divisors is 2x better for day-to-day human use.

This is why the dozenal system will be the primary numeral system in [Star City](https://github.com/WebDevBooster/star-city-manifesto). It's 2 times better (for daily human use) and **everything** in Star City will be at least 2 times better compared to what you're used to.

Our computers will keep using the binary system because that's better for *them*. And in engineering and programming we might keep using the decimal system (for backward compatibility etc.). But for day-to-day *human* use the dozenal system is superior to the decimal system. That's a fact.
